## How it's made (in 10 steps)
1. Open **Figma**
2. Press **F**, click and drag to create a *Frame* (you can adjust dimensions in the right panel under *Layout* — W = width, H = height)
3. Press **O**, click and drag to create a *Shape*
   - **Tip #1:** Hold `Alt` while dragging to grow the Shape or Frame from the center
   - **Tip #2:** Hold `Shift` while dragging to constrain proportions
   - **Tip #3:** Hold `Alt + Shift` while dragging to create perfect circles or squares quickly (*imho*)
4. Apply colors to both Shape(s) and Frame
   - Default base color: `#D9D9D9`
   - **Tip #4:** Press `I` for the eyedropper tool
5. In the *Effects* panel, click **+** and choose **Layer Blur**
6. Adjust until it feels right
7. Drag the Shape(s) into the Frame (if not there already)
   - **Tip #5:** Make sure **Clip content** is checked
8. Position elements, adjust blur, balance colors
9. *(Optional)* Add **Effects → Noise** to reduce banding
10. To export: select the Frame → *Export* → choose format
   - **Tip #6:** PNG = lossless and heavy, JPG = fast and light
